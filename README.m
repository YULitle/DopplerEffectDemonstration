The "frequency" doesn't match actualy frequency. It is inverted. Also, the frame rate messes with the appearance of the frequency, of course. But I plan on setting the frame rate at some high value and then only allowing the frequency to change.

I'd like to add a color coding where the color matched the frequency of light.
