## Doppler Effect Simulator
Use the arrow keys to move the source around. The pause button works. The frequency slider is inverted, but can give you the idea that you want.

### Future work:
- [ ] Fix the frequency issue.
- [ ] Implement a color scheme setting that represents the visible light spectrum.
- [ ] Setting that allows the source to remain focused in the center
